# NSL-KDD-Classification
## A comparison of different classifiers on the NSL-KDD dataset
Four different classifiers (SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and an LSTM deep network) are trained and compared on the well known [NSL-KDD](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html) dataset. <br/>
The complete preprocessing steps are included in case someone finds it useful.
